# CLKModel

CLKModel provides an excellent for your iOS app's data layer.

CLKModel handles parsing to and from JSON, including nested parsing of subsequent CLKModel subclasses, and generic types in arrays.

CLKModel also provides the ability to store a particular property to disk, either using NSUserDefaults of a custom wrapper over Apple's Keychain.  To persist a property in this way uses just one line of code.
